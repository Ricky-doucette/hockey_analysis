# Does a Top NHL Player's Performance in One Season Correlate to Their Production in the Next?
In the folder 'analysis' is found the file 'analysis1.ipynb'.  This is the main file to be ran to see the work done. 

When given the opportunity, for a school assignment in my degree, I used hockey datasets for the 2017/18 and the 2018/19 point summaries to analyse whether performance between consecutive hockey seasons for 200 players who ranked in the top 300 in points for both seasons was correlated. 

I compared offensive and defensive statistics for players to test theories such as if a player's time on ice per game is increased, is there significant evidence to show an increase in points per minute on average for this player in the following season.  Although points per minute is not a typical statistic looked at in the hockey world, it can be used to determine whether a player with increased time on ice will have an increase in points larger than their relative increase in TOI.

Also tested is whether a change in a players performance offensively in consecutive seasons has a negative correlation in their defensive performance.  This is tested to consider questions such as whether players' increase in performance offensively tends to be paired with a decrease in their defensive performances in the following season or not.
