# Does a Top NHL Player's Performance in One Season Correlate to Their Production in the Next?
#### In the folder 'analysis' is found the file 'analysis1.ipynb'.  This is the main file to be ran to see the work done. 

This analysis used hockey datasets for the 2017/18 and the 2018/19 point summaries to analyse whether performance between consecutive hockey seasons for 200 players who ranked in the top 300 in points for both seasons was correlated. 

We compared offensive and defensive statistics for players to test theories such as "If a players' time on ice per game is increased, is there significant evidence to show an increase in points per game on average for these players in the following season?", "Does TOI have significant correlation with any statistics in the following season?", and "Does a change in a player's offensive statistics have a significant negative correlation associating a change in their defensive statistics?" <br />
These were tested to see if increasing players' time on ice resulted an increase in their production / performance and whether players' increase in performance offensively tends to be paired with a decrease in their defensive performances in the following season or not.
